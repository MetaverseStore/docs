## What is Metastore?

The Metastore is a decentralised, cross-game items marketplace where players have complete ownership of their in-game items. It enables users to create and trade game assets such as skins, avatars, and other items.
The Metastore platform is built on top of the <a href="https://tron.network/" target="_blank">Tron network.</a>
