# Creating Characters

We provide you with base 3d mesh on top of which you will create your character.
You can use any 3d software you want to customize the 3d mesh.
We recommend Blender, but you can use any other software you are familiar with.

We provide cross-game compatability by restricting the use of certain bone structure. These bone structure help in animating the character in the game.
Deforming the base bone structure will result in the character not being able to be animated in the game.
Thus we recommend you to not deform the base mesh completely.

Not adhering to this will result your character being removed from the marketplace.
